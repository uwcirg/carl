# CARL

Named after Carl Linnaeus, considered by some as the "father of modern taxonimy", this project
embodies a ``condition classifier``; a logic engine capable of acting on trigger events, querying
an external FHIR store for state and generating conditions when appropriate, pushed back into
the same external FHIR store.
